PA Study Buddy is made by Megan Manley, PA-S. 
This site is maintained by Martin Chase.
Episode zero is a quick introduction to the goals of this project.
In short: As I travel through the clinical year of PA school I am experimenting with a format that necesitates a re-organizing of information that I am studying into a conversational format, hopefully helping to cement multiple levels of understanding.  I hope it will be a helpful study aid for other PA students as well.
